Hey, This is my first e-commerce web application with nextjs and typescript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
### Used technology lists here...
* NextJs, TypeScript, TailwindCss
* npm install react-icons --save

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
